Structure2: enum
  Seq
  Context: List Seq
  Atom: Ident, Symbol, String, Numeric, Operators

Meta2: enum
  Evaluable: ??

meta2: structure -> Meta2
  evaluable <- seq
  idk...



# maybe bind to references, but not execute
# should use be above? idk?
// use nlp

so like
bind meta2 to struture
and create a references thing
i mean... is that a good idea?

maybe?
its prob quite fast right

then let everything run
